# Data Pagination and Filtering
 Project 2

In this student project I worked on the pagination technique. A list of students with their email adresses and pictures etc. should be displayed on several pages. The list can be of various length. To switch between the single pages, buttons are applied. This project only uses "Vanilla" JavaScript.
